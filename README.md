This is a project on detecting, extracting individual faces from a group photo and marking their attendance accordingly in the editable
excel sheet. To be more precise the problem statement was offered by Ministry of Rural Development for the automatic attendance of the workers of
MGNREGA(Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) in the rural areas instead of Manual attendance(which is time taking process) for the effective utilisation of the working hours.
